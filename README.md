### Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my collection of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects. This repository is where I dive into diverse datasets to uncover insights, visualize trends, and understand the underlying patterns. Each project is a self-contained investigation documented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## ## 💡 What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?

EDA is the crucial process of performing initial investigations on data to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations. It's about getting to know your data before you start modeling.

## ## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project primarily uses the following Python libraries:

* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating insightful and beautiful data visualizations.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data exploration and documentation.
